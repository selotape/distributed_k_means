__TODO__

1. ~~use higgs~~
2. ~~report cost like we did (sum dists to nearest center) (instead of siluette)~~
3. run 2 experiments just like python and make sure:
    * same cost
    * same iters
4. ~~get a VERY ROUGH cost estimate for running all_soccer_paper_experiments on 50 small spark workers~~
5. ... measure times ...
6. ... rerun with coreset ...
